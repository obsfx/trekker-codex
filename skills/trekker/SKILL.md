# Trekker

## Overview

Use this skill when work should be tracked across sessions. Prefer the Trekker MCP tools from this plugin for structured reads and writes. If those tools are unavailable, use the `trekker` CLI directly.

Trekker is the durable system of record. `update_plan` is only short-lived session scaffolding.

## Core Rules

1. Search before any task action. Trekker uses FTS5, so start with one distinctive keyword at a time.
2. Restore context before changing anything. Read the task, comments, history, and dependencies first.
3. Keep one active task when practical. Set it to `in_progress` before doing the work.
4. Leave a `Checkpoint:` comment when pausing and a `Summary:` comment before marking work complete.
5. Prefer extending existing tasks over creating duplicates.

## Search-First Workflow

Run search before you create, start, or resume work:

```bash
trekker search "auth"
trekker search "migration"
trekker search "release"
```

Multi-word queries narrow results with AND logic. If the first search is weak, try two or three adjacent keywords separately instead of writing a sentence.

## Context Recovery

For existing work, inspect state in this order:

```bash
trekker task show TREK-12
trekker comment list TREK-12
trekker history --entity TREK-12
trekker dep list TREK-12
```

If `.trekker` does not exist and the user wants persistent tracking, ask before running `trekker init` because it changes project state.

## Working a Task

```bash
trekker task update TREK-12 -s in_progress
trekker comment add TREK-12 -a "codex" -c "Checkpoint: verified the failing path in src/auth.ts. Next: patch token refresh handling."
trekker comment add TREK-12 -a "codex" -c "Summary: fixed refresh-token validation in src/auth.ts and src/session.ts. Removed the duplicate fallback branch."
trekker task update TREK-12 -s completed
trekker ready
```

Use comments for discoveries, blockers, and handoff context. If a task is blocked by something outside the current scope, document why and leave it in a non-terminal state or mark it `wont_fix` with explanation.

## Planning and New Work

For larger features, create an epic first and then wire smaller tasks together with dependencies. Use `update_plan` only as a temporary mirror of what you are doing right now; Trekker remains the durable record.

## Common Mistakes

- Creating a new task before searching.
- Marking work complete without a summary comment.
- Treating `update_plan` as the system of record.
- Assuming Claude-only slash commands or TodoWrite behavior exist in Codex.
